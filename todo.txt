different shapes
character mouths? blinks? other?
button and menu sfx (?)
readme and desc

done:
	sfx for remove question
	way to get to menu from anywhere - escape
	crisis mode
	glass sfx, release sfx, finished sfx, scene change sfx
	hue swap the balls
	need 'thoughts' screen space dialogue (and people canvas dialogue)
	need some kind of score - maybe a timer that ticks down, and a limit on the number of questions?
	need brain bg
	neeed people talking to eachother - lets do 2d for now, ya?
	need 3 levels, then a win screen - maybe dream layer, childhood layer, subconsious layer?
	for more 'gamey-ness', could select a different 'cost' to each question (maybe 3 costs, 3 colors) - and have that also effect the timer?
	Questions can just be normal material - makes z fighting easier

moot:
	have the realizations appear accross the top - and float away?
	Then there is some skill in selecting the low cost questions?
	Don't think I'll have time - but would be cool to add something like 'if you get a ball to this space, all questions are free for 5s' or w/e - heals, delete random blockages, etc
	wind?
