fix the friggen color pallete! mats, 2d portraits, etc

neeed people talking to eachother - lets do 2d for now, ya?
need brain bg
need 'thoughts' screen space dialogue (and people canvas dialogue)
need some kind of score - maybe a timer that ticks down, and a limit on the number of questions?
need 3 levels, then a win screen - maybe dream layer, childhood layer, subconsious layer?
for more 'gamey-ness', could select a different 'cost' to each question (maybe 3 costs, 3 colors) - and have that also effect the timer?
Then there is some skill in selecting the low cost questions?

Questions can just be normal material - makes z fighting easier

Don't think I'll have time - but would be cool to add something like 'if you get a ball to this space, all questions are free for 5s' or w/e - heals, delete random blockages, etc
wind?
